# Messaging &amp; Events

In this part we learn how to use Ignite **messaging &amp; events system**.

## Messaging

Ignite provides a **topic-based** messaging system.

A node can **subscribe** to messages **published** on a **topic** from local node or remote nodes.

Subscribing to topic messages and publishing a message to a topic is as simple as:
```java
import org.apache.ignite.*;

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Ignite ignite = Ignition.start();

        ignite.message().remoteListen("my-topic", (nodeId, message) -> {
            System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
            return true; // keep on listening to new messages
        });

        ignite.message().send("my-topic", "Hello");
    }
}
```

## Events

Ignite also provides an **event-based** notification system.

A node can **subscribe** to events **triggered** on local node or remote nodes.

Events can be things such as: value put in cache, job execution end or failure, node leaving or joining cluster...

Subscribing to events is pretty easy:
```java
import org.apache.ignite.*;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Ignite ignite = Ignition.start();

        ignite.events().remoteListen(
            (nodeId, event) -> {
                System.out.println("event: " + event);
                return true; // keep on listening to new events
            },
            event -> event.type() == EventType.EVT_CACHE_OBJECT_PUT
        );
    }
}
```

Here `put cache` events are filtered on **remote nodes** before being sent to listener.


### :warning:
A **LOT of events** can be generated by an application or internally by **Ignite Kernel**. A special care has to be taken when listening to events, and that's why they are **disabled by default**. For this hands on, only 2 events were enabled in **Config** class to illustrate **events system**.
